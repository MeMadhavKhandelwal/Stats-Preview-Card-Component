## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Atom

### What I learned

This is my first project using Flexbox.

```CSS codes I am proud of:-
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
.features>p {
  color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
  font-size: 0.7rem;
}
.second-card {
  background: url("images/image-header-desktop.jpg");
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(277, 64%, 61%));
}

.second-card {
  background-image: url("images/image-header-desktop.jpg");
  display: block;
  position: relative;
}

.second-card::after {
  content: "";
  background: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  opacity: 0.4;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}
```
